The files provide simulation data for the case studies in the paper "Distributed Stability Certification and Control from Local Data".
The file "Quadruple_tank.dat" contains the simulation data for the case study on computing a Lyapunov function for the stable quadruple tank system.
The file "Helicopter_DRE_practical_convergence.dat" contains the simulation data for the case study showing the practical convergence to the stabilizing solution of the Riccati equation for different values of coupling gain (gamma).
The file "Helicopter_DRE_asymptotic_convergence.dat" constains the simulation data for the case study showing the asymptotic convergence to the stabilizing solution of the Riccati equation for three independent datasets.
